# Recommendations
 
A program that makes personalised book recommendations using a ranking algorithm to predict which books a user is likely to enjoy reading based on her/his past or sample ratings.

If User A enjoyed reading a number of books that User B also enjoyed reading , then when User A recommends another book that User B has not read, chances are that User B would like to read it too. On the other hand, if the two users always tend to disagree about books, then User B is not likely to read a book that the User A recommends.
